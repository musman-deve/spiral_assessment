Developer assessment task.

## Getting Started

Clone the git to your remote setup.
Make sure to run this command in the terminal "flutter pub get"
Then run on a physical device.

## Assets Overview
Inside assets, we have dummy assets like user images.
Fonts, Icons, and Images

# Lib Folder
Inside main.dart, I have set up screenutils which draws the flutter widget according to the screen size and pixel density. This is helpful to create an app that looks the same on all devices.

Then we have two directories
  > Core and Modules.

Core contains utils like app_colors, text_sytles etc...
Modules contains the folders of each module.
  >  Each module have a View Folder inside which contains the screens and widgets.


## Not many libraries have been added, so you don't need to do any platform-specific configurations.
